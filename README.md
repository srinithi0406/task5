# Bringing UI to Life – Animations, Hover Effects & Smooth Transitions

This project enhances a basic e-commerce layout (`ShopZ`) with rich UI interactions using **CSS transitions**, **JavaScript-triggered animations**, and **@keyframes effects** to create a dynamic and engaging user experience.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Smooth Hover Effects
- Buttons (`Shop Now`, `Add to Cart`) and cards have subtle `:hover` effects.
- Transitions on `transform`, `box-shadow`, and `background-color` add polish.

###  2. Navbar Toggle Transitions
- Responsive hamburger menu uses **JavaScript** to toggle navigation with a **smooth slide-down transition**.

###  3. Scroll-Triggered Animations
- Cards (Popular Items) **fade-in and slide-up** as they enter the viewport.
- FAQs and Feedback sections **slide in from left/right** using `IntersectionObserver`.

### 4. Animated Loader with Keyframes
- On feedback form submission, a **spinner** is shown using `@keyframes spin` for rotation animation.

### 5. Modal popup
- Add to Cart button shows success modal popup
